/**
 * Services supported by the referencing packages.
 * The services include finding a <abbr>CRS</abbr> from an authority code,
 * or finding a set of coordinate operations between two <abbr>CRS</abbr>s.
 * Those operations generally require the use of a geodetic registry.
 *
 * <h2>Relationship with factory interfaces</h2>
 * This interface is often the only one needed by users for extracting
 * <abbr>CRS</abbr> and coordinate operation instances from authority codes.
 * For extracting more specific types of <abbr>CRS</abbr>s,
 * or for extracting <abbr>CRS</abbr> components such as coordinate systems or datum,
 * various {@link AuthorityFactory} services may be used.
 * The latter services are often underlying the implementation of a {@code RegisterOperations}
 * and can be made available by the {@link #getFactory(Class)} method.
 * More low-level constructors provided by {@link ObjectFactory} services can also be available.
 *
 * <h2>Getting an instance</h2>
 * Implementers are encouraged to declare their implementations in their {@code module-info} file.
 * Then, users can discover an implementation at runtime using {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} like below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 * RegisterOperations services = ServiceLoader.load(RegisterOperations.class).findFirst().orElseThrow();
 * }

     * <h4>Implementation considerations</h4>
     * Coordinate transformation services should be able to automatically derive coordinate operations
     * that are not stored explicitly in any permanent data store, in other words determine their own
     * concatenated or inverse operations. The reason is that it is practically impossible to store
     * all possible pairs of coordinate reference systems in explicitly defined coordinate operations.
     *
     * <p>Coordinate transformation services should also be able to derive or infer the inverse of any
     * coordinate operation (from <var>B</var> to <var>A</var>) from its complementary forward operation
     * (<var>A</var> to <var>B</var>). Geodetic datasets may record
     * only one of the two operations that may exist between any two coordinate reference systems.
     * The inverse operation is then inferred by the application software logic from the stored operation.
     * In some cases, the algorithm for the inverse operation is the same as the forward algorithm,
     * and only the signs of the parameter values reversed.
     * In some other cases, the forward and inverse methods imply two algorithms, but the parameters values are the same.
     * The latter situation generally applies to map projections.</p>
     *
     * <p>The implementation should apply meaningful constraints and validations to this process.
     * For example, it may be mathematically possible to derive a concatenated coordinate operation
     * that will transform North American Datum 1983 coordinates to Australian National Datum,
     * but in a practical sense that operation would be meaningless.
     * The operation can be determined as invalid with a comparison of the two areas of validity
     * and the conclusion that there is no overlap between these.</p>

     * @param  target  the target <abbr>CRS</abbr>.
     * @return coordinate operations found or inferred between the given pair <abbr>CRS</abbr>s. May be an empty set.
     * @throws FactoryException if an error occurred while searching for coordinate operations.
