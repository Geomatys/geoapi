/**
 * A {@link MeasureReference} which delegates all methods to an existing {@link QualityMeasure} instance.
 * This is used when an {@link QualityElement} provides a full measure description instead of a reference
 * to a registry.
 *
 * <h2>Purpose</h2>
 * ISO 19157 provides no way to get a {@link QualityMeasure} from an {@link QualityElement} or any other data quality object.
 * The only association defined by the standard is a {@link MeasureReference} property inside {@link QualityElement}.
 * The standard expects that users will look for that reference in a registry or catalog for getting the full
 * {@link QualityMeasure} object. This approach makes XML documents smaller, but is not needed for Java interfaces.
 * GeoAPI extends ISO 19157 by allowing implementers to provide {@link QualityMeasure} objects directly.
 * This {@code MeasureReferenceToInstance} class makes the task easier for implementers who choose to provide a
 * {@link QualityMeasure} instead of a {@link MeasureReference}, by inferring automatically the latter from the former.
