Note on update for ISO 19157-1:2023 :

For the QualityEvaluationReportInformation interface, the property getOnlineResource() returns a DS_Resource <<Abstract>>
defined in ISO 19115-1:2014. This object is not derived in GeoApi yet, and is complicated to derive, as all DS_Resources are.

Another property in the same interface, getReportReference(), should be have been conditional to getOnlineResource().
More specifically, if one property is not provided, the other should be provided.

For now, the property getOnlineResource() is merely skipped, and getReportReference() obligation is left unchanged
(i.e. stays mandatory).
