/**
 * Closeness of reported coordinate values to values accepted as being true.
 * Can be used for the following measurement types (non-exhaustive list):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Data quality measures for positional uncertainty in general.</li>
 *   <li>Height measurements as position observations in one dimension.
 *       The height may therefore be treated as a one-dimensional random variable.</li>
 *   <li>Horizontal point locations are defined by a 2D coordinates.
 *       The uncertainty of any point location can be described using the data quality
 *       basic measures for 2D random variables.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Standardized values</h2>
 * In order to achieve well defined and comparable quality information, it is recommended to
 * report data quality using {@linkplain QualityMeasure quality measures} listed in ISO 19157 annex.
 * The following table provides a summary adapted to GeoAPI objects;
 * see ISO 19157 for more complete descriptions and formulas.
 * All identifiers should be in "ISO 19157" namespace.
