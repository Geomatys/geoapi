/**
 * Aspect of quantitative quality information.
 * A data quality element is a component describing a certain aspect of the quality of geographic data.
 * An evaluation of a data quality element is described by the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain #getMeasureReference() Measure}: the type of evaluation;</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain #getEvaluationMethod() Evaluation method}: the procedure used to evaluate the measure;</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain #getQualityResults() Result:} the output of the evaluation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Elements are organized into different categories, which are identified by the following subtypes:
 * {@link Completeness}, {@link LogicalConsistency}, {@link PositionalAccuracy}, {@link TemporalQuality},
 * {@link ThematicAccuracy}, or {@link Metaquality}.

     *   when {@code getMeasure()} is invoked. This method is added in the {@link QualityElement} interface for making
