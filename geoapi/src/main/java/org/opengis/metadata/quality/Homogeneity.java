/**
 * Expected or tested uniformity of the results obtained for a data quality evaluation.
 * Homogeneity consists in comparing the evaluation results of several segments of a global data set.
 * This comparison can be expressed using root mean square errors for example.
 * These tests are often conducted when data has been captured by different operators,
 * depending on the acquisition zone or the acquisition date.
