/**
 * Data quality measure.
 *
 * <h2>Where measures are stored</h2>
 * Measures may be verbose and may not be of interest when only the {@linkplain Element#getResults() result}
 * of data quality measures is desired. For allowing more compact {@link Element}s, ISO 19157 does not store
 * {@code Measure} instance directly into {@link Element}, but instead stores {@link MeasureReference} which
 * can be used for fetching full {@link Measure} description from a measure register or catalogue if desired.
 *
 * <p>GeoAPI extends the ISO 19157 model by allowing {@link Element} to provide directly a {@link Measure} instance.
 * This optional feature gives access to full measure description without forcing users to connect to a catalogue or
 * measure registry. Implementers can fetch the measure description only when first requested, for example by
 * connecting themselves to a catalogue when {@link Element#getMeasure()} is first invoked.</p>
